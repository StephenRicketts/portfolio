        I currently live and work in Montréal, Quebec. In December 2019 I
        graduated from an intensive web development bootcamp through Concordia
        university. I have since continued to improve my skills as a developer
        through additional courses, personal projects, and freelancing. I feel
        confident to say that I am getting pretty good! I find programming to be
        very rewarding. When I finally figure out a tough bug or successfully
        implement a cool feature to a website I can feel my brain grow a little
        larger 🧠.

        My background is unique among most other developers. Prior to 2019 I
        worked in social work and Education. I worked in high stress
        environments with a broad range of different people and always did my
        best to improve their lives in any way I could. Through this work I
        acquired patience and excellent people skills. In 5 or so years, once I
        have become very proficient in the technical side of things, I could see
        myself being a team lead to make use of my soft skills and technical
        skills.
