          I am currently working a 2 month contract for a small start-up called
          SeonVision. This project entails building a website and hooking it up
          to a React admin panel template and then doing the necessary
          customizations to the template. I am using React, tailwindCSS, and
          Firebase for the back end.

          While I am enjoying my work as a freelancer, it is my goal to land a
          junior position with a larger team. I have a lot to offer as an
          employee and think that joining a larger team would allow me to learn
          from more experienced developers.

          I use React and tailwindCSS every day, so I try to keep up with the
          latest features in both. As React is currently my favorite framework,
          I've written a lot of JavaScript so I like to think I've gotten pretty
          good with it. I've worked with other styling frameworks (Sass and
          Bulma) and I am always open to learning new ways of doing things. I
          also have experience working with React Native, TypeScript, Vue.js,
          MongoDB, Firebase, and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a quick learner and I love picking up new skills so I am open to
          learning any language or framework. Being a good Dev means constantly
          learning, so I am currently working on courses in AWS and Next js.
